## You have just found tf-interface

tf-interface is a high-level neural network API that tries to reduce the common tasks in building, training and evaluating neural networks, written in coco and python and build on top of TensorFlow.

**A light wrapper over TensorFlow that enables you to easily create complex deep neural networks using the Builder Pattern through a functional fluent immutable API**

Use tfinterface if you need a deep learning library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (thorugh user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility)

tfinterface is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.

- **Install tfinterface from PyPI (recommended):**
```sh
